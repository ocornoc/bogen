# bogen (WIP)

Procedural generation of card games using a genetic algorithm to optimize for a "fun" value. This also creates, as part of the "fun" fitness function, Monte Carlo Tree Search agents to play the game, thus providing at least one AI (at a future point, maybe multiple of differing skill level) to play against. A furnished frontend is also planned.
